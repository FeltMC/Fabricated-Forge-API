# Fabricated Forge Api
A port of Forge API to Fabric, with the same path as well.

## What is Fabricated Forge API?
Fabricated Forge API is a port of MinecraftForge's api, meant for use for one of these:
- A mod that wants to abstract to run on both forge and fabric, but doesn't want to require some huge dep like architecury api.
- Our eventual compat layer to run forge mods on fabric.

This can be used for other stuff, but we recommend people use fabric and felt api whereever possible, and only use this when absolutly nessecary.

## Quilt?
Quilt is for sleeping :D
